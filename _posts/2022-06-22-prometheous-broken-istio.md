# Draft - work in progress
## Situation
I work up one morning and something had killed my prometheus, specifically a bad Istio uninstall.  I knew this because I'd made no changes but visiting to my usual grafana dashboards

Doing a bit of digging, prometheus operator was failing to start

```bash
kujbectl get deployments -n monitoring

NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
prometheus-operator   0/1     0            0           20m

kubectl describe replicasets.apps -n monitoring

Events:
  Type     Reason        Age                   From                   Message

``` 

So what to do?  Turns out although I had uninstalled the experimental faas solution, bits of istio were clearly left behind.  

Quick look at the api resources bore this out:

```bash
monitoring git:(monitoring) âœ— kubectl get customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io | grep istio

```

At this point I found myself thanking my lucky stars that the experimentation I'd been doing with faas solutions was on a firewalled dev cluster that couldn't disrupt production.

Still no dice.  So time to dig in on 

From this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51489955/how-to-obtain-the-enable-admission-controller-list-in-kubernetes

```bash
kubectl get --raw /apis/admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1/validatingwebhookconfigurations | jq
```

```bash
kubectl get --raw /apis/admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1/validatingwebhookconfigurations | jq '.items[] | select(.metadata.name=="istio-validator-istio-system")'
```

Ha ha, there is the culprit

From there we can nuke that sucker with 

```bash
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io istio-validator-istio-system 
```

Err no still no dice.  Finally with more digging more carefully reading this documentation:

https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/mesh/injection-concepts/

Seems that the culprit is mutating webhook

```bash
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io

NAME                     WEBHOOKS   AGE
cert-manager-webhook     1          214d
istio-sidecar-injector   5          4d

```

Finally.. we are unblocked.

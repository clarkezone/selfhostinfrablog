The state of the project so far is as follows: I have a rasperry pi cluster up and running on my home lan, have a CI/CD flow going and am using cloudflared to proxy traffic to / from the internet.  I have two tiers of monitoring that I'm playing with:

- 1: Cluster level monitoring using Grafana Cloud.  This is using the set of recommended default runbooks to monitor the health of the cluster itself.
- 2: Application level monitoring using the prometheus stack.  This is deployed on the same cluster as the blog application workload and is scrapping  metrics that are workload specific eg generated by nginx that I'm using as a reverse proxy for serving the blog static content as well as by previewd, my custom CI/CD solution used to render content
- 3: Synthetic monitoring made up of a customer deployment of cloudprober, prometheus and alertmanager that I'm running on an independent digital occean droplet

This solution has been serving well so far in the development phase as it is able to detect when a cluster node goes bad, if there is a kubernetes level problem (eg a deployment or pod in a stuck state), an app level problem (eg my CI/CD solution has fallen over) or if

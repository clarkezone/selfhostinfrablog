## Situation
I recently played with a number of the existing FaaS solutions for k8s and none of them did a great job at meeting my needs

OpenFaaS


pros
cons

KNative

pros
cons

1. A cli
2. multiple language support: .NET, golang
3. Minimal tooling / lifting required on the cli side.. eg shouldnâ€™t require docker / podman

### Nice to have

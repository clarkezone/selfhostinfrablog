This is a new temporary blog recording my experiences building a new blogging solution in 2022 using cloud native tech on my own self-hosted kubernetes cluster.  I’m writing content as I work through challenges of getting things setup and posting the content on the new cluster as a test that everything is running. Once we are live in production. I will repost the content on the new blog.  I’m really using this as a diary to record experiences, challenges, problems solutions etc.
